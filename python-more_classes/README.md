# Python - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project dives into the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. You will learn how to build classes, instances, methods, and properties in a Pythonic and professional way.

## Content

### OOP Fundamentals

* **What is OOP?**

* `__str__`: Informal string representation
* `__repr__`: Official string representation

* **Properties** and methods as attributes using `@property`
* **Getters and setters** in Pythonic style
* **Static and class methods** (`@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`)
* **Dynamic attribute creation**
* Using `__dict__`
* Accessing attributes with `getattr`
* Attribute resolution order (MRO)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* What is OOP and why it is powerful in Python
* Difference between cla
