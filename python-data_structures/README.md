# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, and Sequences  

## 📖 **Project Description:**  
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on exploring and applying data structures in Python, specifically lists, tuples, and sequences. Throughout the project, functions are developed to manipulate lists and tuples, applying common methods, list comprehensions, and advanced techniques like tuple packing and unpacking.

## 📝 **Tasks:**  

### **0. Print a list of integers**  
Function that prints all integers in a list.  
- File: `0-print_list_integer.py`  
- Usage: `print_list_integer([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`  
- Expected output:  
1
2
3
4
5


---

### **1. Secure access to an element in a list**  
Function that retrieves an element from a list.  
- File: `1-element_at.py`  
- Usage: `element_at([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)`  
- Expected output:  
Element at index 3 is 4



---

### **2. Replace element**  
Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.  
- File: `2-replace_in_list.py`  
- Usage: `replace_in_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 9)`  
- Expected output:  
[1,2,3,9,5]


---

### **3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!**  
Function that prints all integers in a list in reverse order.  
- File: `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`  

---

### **4. Replace in a copy**  
Function that replaces an element in a specific position of a list without modifying the original list.  
- File: `4-new_in_list.py`  

---

### **5. Can you C me now?**  
Function that removes all occurrences of the characters `c` and `C` from a string.  
- File: `5-no_c.py`  

---

### **6. Lists of lists = Matrix**  
Function that prints a matrix of integers.  
- File: `6-print_matrix_integer.py`  

---

### **7. Tuples addition**  
Function that adds two tuples and returns a new tuple with two elements.  
- File: `7-add_tuple.py`  

---

### **8. More returns!**  
Function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.  
- File: `8-multiple_returns.py`  

---

### **9. Find the max**  
Function that finds the largest integer in a list.  
- File: `9-max_integer.py`  

---

### **10. Only by 2**  
Function that identifies which elements in a list are multiples of 2.  
- File: `10-divisible_by_2.py`  

---

### **11. Delete at**  
Function that deletes an element at a specific position in a list.  
- File: `11-delete_at.py`  

---

### **12. Switch**  
Function that swaps the values of `a` and `b`.  
- File: `12-switch.py`  

---
