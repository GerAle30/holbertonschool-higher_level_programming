# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This project introduces the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, covering key concepts such as classes, instances, encapsulation, and more. It is designed to help understand how Python implements OOP, and how to apply these principles in real-world code.

## üß† Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### üìò General Concepts

* What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* What does "first-class everything" mean in Python
* What is a class
* What is an object and an instance
* Difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is an attribute
* How to use public, protected, and private attributes
* What is `self`
* What is a method
* What is the `__init__` method and how to use it
* What is Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
* What is a property
* Difference between an attribute and a property in Python
* Pythonic way to write getters and setters
* How to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances
* How to bind attributes to objects and classes
* What is the `__dict__` attribute of a class or instance
* How Python finds the attributes of an object or class
* How to use the `getattr` function

## üìö Resources

* [Object Oriented Programming (from Python docs)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
* [Object-Oriented Programming Guide](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/)
* [Properties vs Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
* [Learn to Program 9: OOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE)
* [Python Classes and Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)

## ‚úÖ Project Requirements

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
* All files end with a new line
* First line of each file: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Code must follow `pycodestyle` (PEP 8) version 2.7.\*
* All files must be executable
* Each file, class, and method must include a docstring

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

Each concept was practiced through the implementation of a class `Square` with increasing complexity:

1. Simple empty class
2. Private attributes
3. Initialization and validation
4. Public methods
5. Getters and setters with validation
6. Visual representation using `print`
7. Positional attributes and layout-aware printing
