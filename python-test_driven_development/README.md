# Python - Test-driven development

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology using Python. The main goal is to write tests before the implementation code, promoting a more robust and maintainable development process.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will understand:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What an interactive test is
- Why tests are important in software development
- How to write Docstrings to create tests with `doctest`
- How to properly document each module and function
- What the basic option flags for running tests are
- How to identify and test edge cases

## Project Contents

This project includes Python scripts and corresponding test files that cover a wide range of scenarios:

- Input validation
- Exception handling
- Mathematical and logical operations
- String formatting and indentation
- Matrix and data structure manipulation

## Project Structure


> Each `.py` file is accompanied by a `.txt` file with usage examples and inline documentation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PEP8-compliant code
- Use of `unittest` for test cases
- Use of `doctest` for inline documentation testing (where applicable)

## Running Tests

To run all unit tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
