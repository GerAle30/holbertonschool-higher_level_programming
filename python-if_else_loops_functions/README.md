# Python - Control Flow and Looping

## Description

This project introduces fundamental control flow concepts in Python, including conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and common statements such as `break`, `continue`, and `pass`. The project also covers indentation, the scope of variables, and basic arithmetic operators.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of indentation in Python.
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control program flow.
- Implement loops using `for` and `while`.
- Use `break` and `continue` statements to control loop execution.
- Implement `else` clauses in loops.
- Utilize the `pass` statement as a placeholder.
- Generate sequences using the `range()` function.
- Define and call functions in Python.
- Understand the scope of variables within functions.
- Handle traceback errors and interpret their output.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All Python files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.*
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- The `pycodestyle` version 2.7.* will be used to validate code style
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Usage

To run any of the Python files in this project, use the command:

```bash
./<filename>.py
